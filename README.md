# Cryptocons

> This package is being updated rapidly and rather recklessly at the moment. Feel free to install it but changes icons are being added rapidly.

## What is Cryptocons?

Cryptocons is a collection of named icon modules and utility functions making it easier to manage cryptocurreny icons in your project.

Each icon is placed on a 24x24 grid and available as two types:

1. **Logo**: Plain logomark icons
2. **Badge**: Logomark icons contained in a shape that can be configured with different border radiuses from square to circle.

## Installation

To install the package in your project run:

```bash
yarn add cryptocons

or

npm i cryptocons
```

---

## Usage

Each icon is wrapped in a `forwardRef` that exposes the underlying SVG element. Any valid SVG property can be added to an icon.

### Basic usage

Once the package is installed, importing and using icons is a pretty simple process. Named Icon modules can be imported.

```jsx
import { Binance } from 'cryptocons'

<Binance>
```

### Bundled Icon components

Cryptocons exposes two specialty components that aggregate all available icons from a given type (either Badge or Logo).

TODO: Write this

### Changing icon size

Aside from regular SVG properties, each icon has a limited set of component properties. One of them is `size`. The size property is equivalent to setting the height and width of the SVG. The following examples are all fuctionally the same.

```jsx
import { BinanceBadge } from 'cryptocons'

<BinanceBadge size={32}>
<BinanceBadge height={32} width={32}>
<BinanceBadge size="32px">
<BinanceBadge height="32px" width="32px">
```

### Changing Badge radius

Another component property exclusive to Badge icon types is `badgeRadius`. Setting a `badgeRadius` will round the corners from a square to a circle depending on the number. Setting a badgeRadius on an icon that isn't a Badge will have no effect. The default radius is `12`.

```jsx
import { Binance, BinanceBadge } from 'cryptocons'

// This will have no effect
<Binance badgeRadius={12}>
// This will result in a squircle
<BinanceBadge size={8}>
// This will result in a square
<BinanceBadge size={0}>
// This will result in a circle
<BinanceBadge size={100}>
// This is redundant as the default radius is 12
<BinanceBadge size={12}>
```

### Creating custom icons

Two methods for creating your icons:

-   The `Icon` component
-   The `createIcon` convenience function

The Icon component renders an SVG element to create custom icons on the fly. The createIcon function is a convenience wrapper allowing you to achieve the same result with less effort. The default `viewBox` is `0 0 24 24` when using the `createIcon` function. The Icon component will need supplied a `viewBox`. Every example below creates the same icon.

```jsx
import { Icon, createIcon } from 'cryptocons'

const CircleIcon = () => (
    <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    </Icon>
)

const CircleIcon = createIcon({
    path: (
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    ),
})
```

## Develop locally

If you want to tinker or contribute to Cryptocons, you will need to build the repo locally.

The content within the `scripts` directory is what automatically transforms XML into React components from within the `svg` directory. Most of the functions within are refactored and updated from the [svg2jsx](https://github.com/balajmarius/svg2jsx) library.

### Build

#### 1. Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

#### 2. Run the scripts

```bash
yarn build
```

This will use `ts-node` to run all the functions in the `scripts` directory. These scripts will optimize, transform, and reformat the content within the `svg` directory into React components in the `components` directory.

#### 3. Run Storybook to view changes

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This will build the components within the `components` directory to `localhost:8000`. Any changes made to components will automatically rerender.

### Accessibility

Implementing icons accessibly can be tricky. Paraphrasing from [CSS Tricks on accessible SVG implementation](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/) and [other references](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svg-icons/), an icon can be implemented in 2 main ways.

#### 1. Decorative

Cryptocon icons assume decorative intent. What this means is icons have `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` set by default. It's favorable to let assistive technology instead of the icon recognize parent elements. SVG elements with an `aria-label` are more verbose because they are announced as a group, so it's favorable to go with `aria-label` on the primary interactive parent element.

```jsx
<button onClick={navigateHome}>
    <BinanceBadge />
    Navigate home
</button>
```

```jsx
<button aria-label="Do Binance action">
    <BinanceBadge />
</button>
```

When icons are wrapped by an interactive element, whatâ€™s important is that the link has informative text. Therefore, if a component can be described by visible text, it is recommended to reference that text with an `aria-label` attribute rather than using the `title` property.

```jsx
<a href="/" aria-label="Navigate home">
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

```jsx
<a href="/">
    Navigate home
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

#### 2. Standalone

> This implementation is discouraged. It's best to use an IconButton instead as it contains accessible interaction states.

Suppose the icon is being used as a standalone interactive element and isn't accompanied by a visible text label. In that case, it's best to use a combination of `role`, `aria-label`, and ensuring the icon can be discovered by assistive technology by setting `aria-hidden` to `false`.

```jsx
<Home
    onClick={navigateHome}
    role="img"
    aria-label="Navigate home"
    aria-hidden={false}
/>
```
